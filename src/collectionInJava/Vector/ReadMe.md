# Vector Class
1. Introduced In Java Version 1.0 
2. **Vector** implements a dynamic array which means it can grow or shrink as required. Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index.
3. It is similar to **ArrayList**. 
4. Vector is **synchronized** and has some legacy methods that the collection framework does not contain. 
5. It also maintains an insertion order like an ArrayList. Still, it is rarely used in a non-thread environment as it is synchronized, and due to this, it gives a poor performance in adding, searching, deleting, and updating its elements.
6. The Iterators returned by the Vector class are fail-fast. In the case of concurrent modification, it fails and throws the ConcurrentModificationException.
7. It extends AbstractList and implements List interfaces.
8. It implements Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, List<E>, RandomAccess interfaces.
9. The directly known subclass is Stack.

### Important points regarding the Increment of vector capacity are as follows:
1. If the increment is specified, Vector will expand according to it in each allocation cycle. Still, if the increment is not specified, then the vectorâ€™s capacity gets doubled in each allocation cycle. Vector defines three protected data members:
- int capacityIncreament: Contains the increment value.
- int elementCount: Number of elements currently in vector stored in it.
- Object elementData[]: Array that holds the vector is stored in it.
